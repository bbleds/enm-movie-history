## Movie History App
Movie Time tracks allows users to create an account, find movies, add movies to their own collection, search their collection and mark movies watched, unwatched, and rated.

### Progress
Nov. 23rd, 2015
App development is complete up to the point of searching a user's own movie collection. Users are able to find and add movies, then search their collection. Progress still needs to be made to mark movies watched, rate the movies, and search by watched or unwatched. Functionality also still needs to be built to delete movies from a user's collection.
